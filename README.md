# Bluetooth Chat Application Android
A simple bluetooth chat application developed on Android Studio. <br />
On start up, the app requests permission to switch on bluetooth.<br />
One device lists all the once-paired devices. And connects to a particular device from the list. <br />
The other device listens for incoming connection request and then both the devices get connected. <br />
Tapping on the number sends the number directly. A custom text message can also be sent by typing in the EditText and then tapping the send custom message button.

 # In Action:
This is the main page in the app
